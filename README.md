## Project Descriptions

### Project 1: CO2 Emissions Analysis

The CO2 Emissions Analysis project analyzes a dataset on CO2 emissions by vehicles. The dataset captures details on how CO2 emissions can vary with different vehicle features such as fuel type, transmission, engine size, and more. The project includes SQL queries and analysis to calculate average emissions, compare emissions by fuel type and vehicle class, examine the impact of engine size and number of cylinders on emissions.

## Usage

Each project folder contains a README file with specific instructions, explanations, and any additional resources required to run or understand the project. You can run the SQL queries against your preferred database management system to obtain the results.

Please note that the datasets used in the projects are not included in this repository. However, the README files within each project folder provide information on the data sources and instructions on how to obtain the datasets, if available.
