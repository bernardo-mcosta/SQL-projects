## Project Descriptions

### Project 1: CO2 Emissions Analysis

The CO2 Emissions Analysis project analyzes a dataset on CO2 emissions by vehicles. The dataset captures details on how CO2 emissions can vary with different vehicle features such as fuel type, transmission, engine size, and more. The project includes SQL queries and analysis to calculate average emissions, compare emissions by fuel type and vehicle class, examine the impact of engine size and number of cylinders on emissions.

### Project 2: Nashville Housing Market Data Cleaning

The Nashville Housing Data Cleaning project focuses on cleaning and transforming a dataset containing sale data from the Nashville housing market. The dataset includes information about property sales, addresses, dates, and other relevant details. The project utilizes SQL queries to standardize date formats, populate missing property addresses, split address fields into individual columns (address, city, state), clean fields and remove duplicate entries.


## Usage

Each project folder contains a README file with specific instructions, explanations, and any additional resources required to run or understand the project. You can run the SQL queries against your preferred database management system to obtain the results.

Please note that the datasets used in the projects are not included in this repository. However, the README files within each project folder provide information on the data sources and instructions on how to obtain the datasets, if available.
